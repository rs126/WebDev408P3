# web-dev-starter

This projects main objective is to style a birdwatching themed webpage with CSS. 
This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML and formatted in CSS. 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project. When index.html file is
opened the preview icon will appear at the top right corner. Once clicked you can
either copy and paste the address it gives you into a browser window or leave
it displayed at the side. 

## Testing

Note: The main point of the project was to learn how to format with CSS. Therefore,
There are tests leftover from the template but they will not work.

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
